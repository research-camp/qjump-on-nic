This kernel module uses Netfilter hooks to intercept outgoing TCP packets and print their source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and packet data.

Remember, working with kernel modules requires caution. Ensure you are testing this in an appropriate environment as kernel modules can crash the system if not implemented correctly. Also, the code might need adjustments based on the kernel version and system configuration.

To sort the NIC queue's packets based on their PIDs, you'll need to access the process ID (PID) associated with each packet and sort them accordingly. Here's an extended version of the previous code with PID sorting.

This updated code includes:

insert_packet function: Adds packets along with their PIDs to the packet_queue.
compare function: Used by qsort to sort the packet queue based on PIDs.
process_queue function: Sorts and processes the packets in the queue when it's full or at certain intervals.

This module now queues packets with their associated PIDs and sorts them based on PIDs using qsort. Then, it processes and prints the packets in PID-sorted order when the queue reaches its limit or at specific intervals (as defined in process_queue).
